Installs the Maxis Highway Override plugin (AKA Project Symphony), which reskins the base Maxis Highway network to better match with the RealHighway (RHW) system.  Note that this option is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE ORIGINAL MAXIS HIGHWAY INTERCHANGES, and instead relies on its own interchanges, plus the RHW's modular interchange capabilities.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to install at least the Base and Small Network features for the RealHighway if planning on using the Maxis Highway Override.
